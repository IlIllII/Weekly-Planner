# Weekly-Planner

## About
This is a weekly planner app that I built to better understand Vue. If you want to use the [app](https://my-weekly-planner.netlify.app/) you can, otherwise you can also clone and run the project yourself:

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
